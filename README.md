These programs accompany the book
"Computer Simulation of Liquids" by M. P. Allen and D. J. Tildesley,
second edition, to be published by Oxford University Press.
They are made freely available, in the hope that they will be useful.
The intention is to clarify points made in the text,
rather than to provide a piece of code
suitable for direct use in a research application.

## Disclaimer
We ascribe no commercial value to the programs themselves.
Although a few complete programs are provided,
our aim has been to offer building blocks rather than black boxes.
As far as we are aware, the programs work correctly,
but we can accept no responsibility for the consequences of any
errors;
we should be grateful to hear from you if you find any.
You should always check out a routine for your particular application.

## Language
The programs contain some explanatory comments, and
are written, in the main, in Fortran 2003.
Fortran provides a standard way of inter-operating with C.
